Track spending against tag-based budget categories with monthly rollovers.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot -->

## How it works

Create budget categories linked to transaction tags. When you tag a transaction (e.g., `groceries`, `dining`, `entertainment`), it automatically counts against that category's budget. Unspent amounts roll over to the next month.

## What you'll see

- **Category spending** - How much you've spent vs. budgeted in each category
- **Monthly rollovers** - Unspent budget carries forward automatically
- **Progress bars** - Visual indicators showing where you stand
- **Overspending alerts** - Clear warning when you exceed a category

## Getting started

Create your first budget category and link it to a tag. Then tag your transactions - the plugin handles the rest.
